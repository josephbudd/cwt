We can control when this PCM interrupt is generated, by setting a period size, which is set in frames.

Thus, if we set 16-bit stereo @ 44.1Khz,
  and the period_size to 4410 frames
  => (
    for 16-bit stereo @ 44.1Khz,
    1 frame equals 4 bytes.
    So 4410 frames equal 4410*4 = 17640 bytes
  ).
  => an interrupt will be generated each 17640 bytes - that is, each 100 ms.

Correspondingly, buffer_size should be at least 2*period_size = 2*4410 = 8820 frames (or 8820*4 = 35280 bytes).
