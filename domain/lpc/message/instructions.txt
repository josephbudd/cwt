MANAGING LPC MESSAGES WITH kicklpc.

* Use kicklpc in this application's root folder:
  $ cd github.com/josephbudd/cwt/

* Listing all of the messages:
  $ kicklpc -l
  1. kicklpc would
    * Display the names of each LPC message.

* Adding a message:
  $ kicklpc -add UpdateCustomer
  1. kicklpc would
    * Add the file domain/lpc/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Add the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Update the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/dispatch.go
  2. You would need to
  * Complete the message definitions in domain/lpc/UpdateCustomer.go
  * Complete the func handleUpdateCustomer in mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/UpdateCustomer.go

* Deleting a message:
  $ kicklpc -delete-forever UpdateCustomer
  1. kicklpc would
    * Delete the file domain/lpc/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Delete the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Update the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/dispatch.go
