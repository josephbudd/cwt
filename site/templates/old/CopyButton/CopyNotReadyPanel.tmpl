This is one of a group of 2 panels displayed when the "Copy" button is clicked.

This panel is just 1 in a group of 2 panels.
Your other panel in this group is

  * The tab bar <div #tabsMasterView_home_pad_CopyButton_CopyReadyPanel_tab_bar
  * But the panel is a tab bar so you won't be adding any content there.
